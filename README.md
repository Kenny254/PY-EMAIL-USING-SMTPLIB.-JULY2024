A guide through setting up and running a Python script to send an email using smtplib. 

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Install Required Library (if not installed)
If you haven't installed smtplib, you can install it using pip:

-------   Copy code:  pip install secure-smtplib





Step 2: Write the Python Script
Create a new Python script (e.g., send_email.py) and paste the following code into it. Replace placeholders your_email@gmail.com, your_password, and recipient_email@gmail.com with your actual email addresses and password.




Step 3: Run the Script
Save the script and run it from your terminal or command prompt:

--------   Copy code:     python send_email.py



Notes:
Ensure that you have allowed less secure apps to access your Gmail account if you encounter authentication issues. You might also need to use an App Password if you have two-factor authentication enabled.
Replace "your_email@gmail.com", "your_password", and "recipient_email@gmail.com" with your actual Gmail email address, password, and the recipient's email address.
This script will send an email with the specified subject and body to the recipient's email address.
